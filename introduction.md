# Introduction

## Why reproducible micromagnetics?
There is growing interest and pressure for scientific publications to be reproducible. 

It is a fundamental principle of science that results are accepted as scientifically true if they can be reproduced by a different research group. 
 
Furthermore, the effectiveness of science is much higher if published results can be re-executed and then extended by other groups within hours or days rather than having to re-create a large part of the published work just to re-create what is published already.

Funding bodies and scientific journals have started to demand publication of data, software and increasing reproducibility.

## What is needed for reproducible computational science?

In the area of computational micromagnetics (and similarly in computational and data science in general), this can be achieved by archiving:

- the software that was used
  - the version of that software
  - ideally the source code
- configuration files used 
- calls to software: what were the precise parameters
- the workflow: starting with the data set (or configuration file), which intermediate file has been produced, and which figure (for example) in the publication has been created from that.
- ideally, also the operating system and version, and the support libraries (such as numpy, lapack, etc) that may have been used implicitly are recorded. 

## Imperfect information is better than none

Various researchers have started to offer digital information in addition to
their paper manuscripts, and some of these are collected in the list [in this
file](README.md).

Most of them do not provide all the scripts to re-create all data on which the
corresponding publication is based. Nevertheless, what is provided is generally
useful, and a contribution to more effective science.
